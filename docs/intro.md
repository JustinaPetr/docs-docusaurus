# The Composable Data Network

Ceramic is a decentralized data network that powers an ecosystem of interoperable Web3 applications and services. Ceramic's event streaming protocol is a highly-scalable decentralized data infrastructure used for building all kinds of interoperable Web3 services and protocols, such as decentralized databases. Ceramic-powered databases and services enable thousands of Web3 developers to build data-intensive applications and solve the world's most complex data challenges. By decentralizing application databases, Ceramic makes data composable and reusable across all applications.

## Introduction to Ceramic
---

- Try the [**ComposeDB Quickstart**](https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.5.x/getting-started) to try the newest Ceramic-powered graph database

- Head to the [**Ceramic Protocol**](./protocol/js-ceramic/overview.md) section to learn about lower-level Ceramic functionality

- Explore use cases and projects [**built on Ceramic**](https://threebox.notion.site/Ceramic-Ecosystem-a3a7a58f81544d33ad3feb84368775d4)

## Build Applications

---

### [**ComposeDB: Graph DB for Web3 Apps â†’**](https://composedb.js.org/)

ComposeDB is a decentralized graph database powered by Ceramic that enables you to build powerful Web3 applications using composable data, GraphQL, and reusable models. ComposeDB is the newest and most popular database built on Ceramic.

## Run a Ceramic Node

---

Run a Ceramic node to provide data storage, compute, and bandwidth for your Ceramic application. Today there are no tokenized incentives for running a Ceramic node, but by running a node you can ensure the data for your app remains available while helping contribute to the network's decentralization.
