title: ComposeDB API Sandbox
description: Test out example GraphQL queries on ComposeDB to learn how to access documents by relations, how to filter, and more.

import Sandbox from '../../src/components/sandbox/Sandbox';
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';


# Sandbox

Test out several pre-made example queries below to gain hands-on exposure to accessing documents by relations, filtering and ordering by fields, and combining query logic.

For a deeper dive into querying, visit the [**queries**](/docs/composedb/interact-with-data) page.

## Reading Data

---

#### Data Models

The schema definitions that this section of the sandbox uses are outlined in [**this repository**](https://github.com/ceramicstudio/ComposeDBExampleApp/tree/main/composites). The sandbox has been pre-populated with data corresponding to several fictionary people.

#### Instructions

To interact with the ComposeDB read-only Sandbox, simply press the pink play icon to execute the pre-written queries in the left-hand side of the embedded GraphiQL IDE. Results returned from your query will populate in the right-hand side of the interface.

You can also alter your query logic however you see fit, or build your own queries entirely from scratch based on the schema definitions.

### Reading Profiles

---

Use the example queries below to access data related to the `BasicProfile` model:



<Sandbox queries='profiles' />

<br />
---

### Reading Posts

---

Use the example queries below to access data related to the `Posts` model:



<Sandbox queries='posts' />

<br />
---

### Reading Comments

---

Use the example queries below to access data related to the `Comments` model:


<Sandbox queries='comments' />
