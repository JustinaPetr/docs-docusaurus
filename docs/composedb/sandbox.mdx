# Sandbox

Test out several pre-made example queries below to gain hands-on exposure to accessing documents by relations, filtering and ordering by fields, and combining query logic.

For a deeper dive into querying, visit the [**queries**](../docs/composedb/guides/data-interactions/queries) page.

## Reading Data

---

#### Data Models

The schema definitions that this section of the sandbox uses are outlined in [**this repository**](https://github.com/ceramicstudio/ComposeDBExampleApp/tree/main/composites). The sandbox has been pre-populated with data corresponding to several fictionary people.

#### Instructions

To interact with the ComposeDB read-only Sandbox, simply press the pink play icon to execute the pre-written queries in the left-hand side of the embedded GraphiQL IDE. Results returned from your query will populate in the right-hand side of the interface.

You can also alter your query logic however you see fit, or build your own queries entirely from scratch based on the schema definitions.

### Reading Profiles

---

Use the example queries below to access data related to the `BasicProfile` model:



<div style={{height: "60rem", width: "100%", margin: "auto"}}><Sandbox queries='profiles' /></div>

<br />
---

### Reading Posts

---

Use the example queries below to access data related to the `Posts` model:



<div style={{height: "60rem", width: "100%", margin: "auto"}}><Sandbox queries='posts' /></div>

<br />
---

### Reading Comments

---

Use the example queries below to access data related to the `Comments` model:


<div style={{height: "60rem", width: "100%", margin: "auto"}}><Sandbox queries='comments' /></div>


<br />

## Writing Data

---

#### Data Models

The following sandbox section will allow you to create Ceramic documents using mutations. For this section, we will be using a different model definition:

```GraphQL
enum Proficiency {
  Beginner
  Intermediate
  Advanced
  Expert
}

type Language {
  JavaScript: Proficiency
  Python: Proficiency
  Rust: Proficiency
  Java: Proficiency
  Swift: Proficiency
  Go: Proficiency
  Cpp: Proficiency
  Scala: Proficiency
  WebAssembly: Proficiency
  Solidity: Proficiency
  Other: Proficiency
}

type CeramicDeveloper
  @createModel(accountRelation: SINGLE, description: "A Ceramic developer") {
  developer: DID! @documentAccount
  languages: Language!
}
```

You will use this model to self-describe your own development skills, and will therefore require you to alter the given examples to meet your actual abilities.

#### Authentication

You will first have to self-authenticate on our Ceramic node. This is required for making mutation queries, whereas you do not have to be authenticated on a given node to read its data.

<div style={{height: "100%", width: "100%", margin: "auto"}}><Connect /></div>

Your browser wallet should create a prompt for you that looks something like this:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
![Sign in prompt](/img/sign-in.png)
</div>

Notice how there's 1 model listed under "Resources" in the prompt - the model listed here is the StreamID of the model definition shown in GraphQL above that we've already deployed onto Ceramic. By signing this prompt, you are creating a temporary session that allows the current application to create edits on your behalf _only_ to the resources you've granted access to (in this case, our `CeramicDeveloper` schema).

View how we're doing this for yourself in [this component]('../../src/components/sandbox/SandboxConnect').

### Creating a Record

Now that you're authenticated, you'll be able to create a `CeramicDeveloper` profile of your own!

<div style={{height: "60rem", width: "100%", margin: "auto"}}><MutationSandbox queries='mutations' /></div>

### Developer Feed

<div style={{height: "100%", width: "100%", margin: "auto", marginBottom: "5%", display : 'flex', flexDirection: "row"}}>


<FeedExample  />

</div>
